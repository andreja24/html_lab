    <p> About a Boy is a 2002 romantic comedy-drama film directed by Paul Weitz and Chris Weitz, who co-wrote <br /> 
        the screenplay with Peter Hedges. It is an adaptation of the 1998 novel of the same name by Nick Hornby.<br /> 
        The film stars Hugh Grant, Nicholas Hoult, Toni Collette, and Rachel Weisz. The film at times uses double <br />
        voice-over narration, when the audience hears alternately Will's and Marcus's thoughts.
