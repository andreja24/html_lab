        The Forest of the Gods is a memoir written in 1945 by a Lithuanian writer and poet Balys Sruoga. <br /> 
        It reflects the writer's experiences in the Nazi concentration camp, to which B. Sruoga was sent<br /> 
        in 1943. The memoir is full of irony and mockery of the order of the camps, the treatment of <br /> 
        the prisoners, and indeed of the entire current situation.
